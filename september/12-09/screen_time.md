Screen Time
Given an input array of seven integers, representing a week's time, where each integer is the amount of hours spent on your phone that day, determine if it is too much screen time based on these constraints:

If any single day has 10 hours or more, it's too much.
If the average of any three days in a row is greater than or equal to 8 hours, it’s too much.
If the average of the seven days is greater than or equal to 6 hours, it's too much.
Tests:
Waiting:1. too_much_screen_time([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) should return False.
Waiting:2. too_much_screen_time([7, 8, 8, 4, 2, 2, 3]) should return False.
Waiting:3. too_much_screen_time([5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]) should return False.
Waiting:4. too_much_screen_time([1, 2, 3, 11, 1, 3, 4]) should return True.
Waiting:5. too_much_screen_time([1, 2, 3, 10, 2, 1, 0]) should return True.
Waiting:6. too_much_screen_time([3, 3, 5, 8, 8, 9, 4]) should return True.
Waiting:7. too_much_screen_time([3, 9, 4, 8, 5, 7, 6]) should return True.
